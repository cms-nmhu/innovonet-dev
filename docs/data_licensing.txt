  Data Licensing
* * * * * * * * * *


A data licence explains to your users what they can and cannot do with your
equipment data.  This applies to both the data available through the API and
through your catalogue's normal website pages.

You should use your local config to define exactly which licence you wish to
use. Kit-Catalogue includes settings for the UK's Open Goverment Licence as a
useful default.

   *  Which ever licence you choose to use, check its terms are suitable *
   *  for your institution before making it visible on your catalogue.   *
   * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *


By default, the Kit-Catalogue software does not show any data licence
description or link. You can enable it by setting the appropriate local config
entry to read:

  $config['data.licence_enabled'] = true;  

To change which data licence information is shown, alter these settings
accordingly:

  $config['data.licence_name'] = '<name of your licence>';

  $config['data.licence_link'] = '<URL-of-full-licence-information>';


If you omit the 'name' setting, only the link will be shown, and vice-versa.
